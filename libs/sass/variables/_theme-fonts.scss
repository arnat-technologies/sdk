/*!
 * Theme Fonts and Text Sizes
 *
 * The variables in this file represent all font families and text sizes used
 * throughout the project. Keeping these centrally managed makes it easier to
 * maintain over the life of the project. At the top are general font variables,
 * which can and should be used to set the context-specific variables later in
 * the file. As a general rule, only the context-specific variables should be
 * used outside of this file.
 *
 * Text size variables can be either a single value, a list of values, or a map.
 * Font style variables can be either a single value or a list of values. See the
 * documentation of the mixin set-text-style in /scss/globals/mixins/_text-display.scss
 * for details of how these variables will be used.
