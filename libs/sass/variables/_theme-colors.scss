/*!
 * Theme Colors
 *
 * The variables in this file represent all colors applied throughout the
 * project. Variables should be context-specific and unique per location.
 * At the top is the general color palette, which can and should be used to
 * set the context-specific variables later in the file. As a general rule,
 * only the context-specific variables should be used outside of this file.
 *
 * Variables can be either a single value or a list of values. In the case of a
 * list, the list is treated as (background, foreground, border). You can leave
 * off values from the list, but not skip values. For example, a list of two colors
 * will be treated as (background, foreground).
