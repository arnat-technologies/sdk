 * Responsive Square Mixins SCSS
 *
 * Apply to something you want to be responsively square. Magic trick that
 * makes a container height always match its width.
 *
 * Assumes an HTML structure like:
 * <div class="square">
 *     <div class="content">
 *         Hello!
 *     </div>
 * </div>
 *
 * The responsive-square mixin is called on the outer div, not to the inner content
